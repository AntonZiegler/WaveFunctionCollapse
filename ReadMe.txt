Hello,
Welcome to my Repo on Wave Function Collapse. 
This is split into two different parts, the first is the essay that was written to examine the algorithm. 
The second is a Unity project that was created to show the algorithm in action.
The code that runs the project is found in the Assets/Scripts folder, and can be run as long as you have the unity tile pallete installed.
Included are a couple still images of inputs (on the left), and outputs (on the right) that the project created. 

thank you,
Anton
